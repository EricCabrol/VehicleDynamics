## Some major books about Vehicle Dynamics

### The reference about tires ###

* **Hans B Pacejka, _Tyre and Vehicle Dynamics_, Butterworth-Heinemann, (2002 - 2006 - 2012)**

670 pages<br />
Professor Pacejka from Delft University is the author of the well-known Magic Formula, and his book is definitely an undisputed reference on the subject.

### The classic ones ###

* **J.Y. Wong. _Theory of Ground Vehicles_ (1978 - 1993 - 2001 - 2008)**

560 pages. Seven chapters (see details on [wiley](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Theory+of+Ground+Vehicles%2C+4th+Edition-p-9780470170380) website).<br />
Covers off-road vehicles, including tractors, etc. Includes a whole chapter on "terramechanics" (vehicle terrain interaction).

* **John C Dixon, _Tires, Suspension and Handling_ (1991 - 1996)**

621 pages<br />
Quite advanced, and rather short on illustrations. 
No ebook available on [Google Books](https://books.google.fr/books?id=r6pTAAAAMAAJ), you can find the paper version on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.fr/Tires-Suspension-Handling-John-Dixon/dp/1560918314).
  The author also wrote _The Shock Absorber Handbook_ and _Suspension Geometry and computation_

* **T. Gillespie, _Fundamentals of Vehicle Dynamics_ (1992)**

Intermediate level. <br />
The only classic without any updated edition ? Looks quite old now. Chapters about acceleration and braking performance, road load, aerodynamics, rolling resistance, ride, steady-state cornering, suspensions, steering system, rollover, tires. 
Some examples with solutions at the end of each chapter.


* **W. Milliken & D. Milliken, _Race Car Vehicle Dynamics_ (1995)**

* **W. Milliken & D. Milliken, _Chassis Design - Principles and Analysis_ (2002)**

* **G. Genta, _Motor Vehicle Dynamics. Modeling and Simulation_ (1997)**

### More recent books ###

* **Reza N Jazar, _Vehicle Dynamics, Theory and Application_ (2008 - 2014 - 2017)**

988 pages<br />
Springer website claims that the 3rd edition has been reduced by 25% ("to allow for coverage over one semester"), but there is still approximately one thousand pages ...
Professor Jazar also wrote _Advanced Vehicle Dynamics_ published in 2019, rather intended for post-graduate students.

* **Rajesh Rajamani, _Vehicle Dynamics and Control_ (2006 - 2012)**

524 pages<br />
In the second edition of the book, chapters on roll dynamics, rollover prevention and hybrid electric vehicles have been added, and the chapter on electronic stability control has been enhanced.

* **Bruce Minaker, _Fundamentals of Vehicle Dynamics and Modelling_ (2019)**

See my [detailed review](https://github.com/EricCabrol/VehicleDynamics/blob/master/Minaker.md)

### French-speaking only ###

* **Thierry Halconruy, _Les liaisons au sol_ (1995 - 200 pages)**

* **Jean-Pierre Brossard, _Dynamique du véhicule: Modélisation des systèmes complexes_ (2013 - 710 pages)**


### Some I haven't read .. yet :) ###

* Rao V Dukkipati and others, _Road Vehicle Dynamics_, SAE, 2008
* Georg Rill, _Road Vehicle Dynamics: Fundamentals and Modeling_, 2011 
* D. J. N. Limebeer and Matteo Massaro, _Dynamics and Optimal Control of Road Vehicles_, 2018
