## Some major books about Vehicle Dynamics

### The reference about tires ###

* **Hans B Pacejka, _Tyre and Vehicle Dynamics_, Butterworth-Heinemann, (2002 - 2006 - 2012)**

670 pages
Professor Pacejka from Delft University is the author of the well-known Magic Formula, and his book is definitely an undisputed reference on the subject.

### The classic ones ###

* **J.Y. Wong. _Theory of Ground Vehicles_ (1978 - 1993 - 2001 - 2008)**

560 pages
Covers off-road vehicles, including tractors, etc. Includes a whole chapter on "terramechanics" (vehicle terrain interaction).
Seven chapters (see details on [wiley](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Theory+of+Ground+Vehicles%2C+4th+Edition-p-9780470170380) website).
  


* **John C Dixon, _Tires, Suspension and Handling_ (1991 - 1996)**

621 pages.
Quite advanced, and rather short on illustrations. 
No ebook available on [Google Books](https://books.google.fr/books?id=r6pTAAAAMAAJ), you can find the paper version on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.fr/Tires-Suspension-Handling-John-Dixon/dp/1560918314).
 
 The author also wrote _The Shock Absorber Handbook_ and _Suspension Geometry and computation_

* **T. Gillespie, Fundamentals of Vehicle Dynamics (1992)**

The only classic without any updated edition ? Looks quite old now.
Poor review [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R104E7C5XMGASH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1560911999#R104E7C5XMGASH) on Amazon.

* **W. Milliken & D. Milliken, Race Car Vehicle Dynamics (1995)**

* **W. Milliken & D. Milliken, Chassis Design - Principles and Analysis (2002)**

* **G. Genta."Motor Vehicle Dynamics. Modeling and Simulation" (1997)**

### More recent books ###

* **Reza N Jazar, _Vehicle Dynamics, Theory and Application_ (2008 - 2014 - 2017)**

988 pages
Springer website claims that the 3rd edition has been reduced by 25% ("to allow for coverage over one semester"), but there is still approximately one thousand pages ...

Professor Jazar also wrote _Advanced Vehicle Dynamics_ published in 2019, rather intended for post-graduate students.


* **Rajesh Rajamani, _Vehicle Dynamics and Control_ (2006 - 2012)**

524 pages
In the second edition of the book, chapters on roll dynamics, rollover prevention and hybrid electric vehicles have been added, and the chapter on electronic stability control has been enhanced.


### French-speaking only ###

* **Thierry Halconruy, _Les liaisons au sol_ (1995 - 200 pages)**

* **Jean-Pierre Brossard, _Dynamique du véhicule: Modélisation des systèmes complexes_ (2013 - 710 pages)**
