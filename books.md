## Some major books about Vehicle Dynamics

### The classic ones ###

* J.Y. Wong. **Theory of Ground Vehicles**, John Wiley & sons, 2008 (4th edition, 560 pages).

Covers off-road vehicles, including tractors, etc. Includes a whole chapter on "terramechanics" (vehicle terrain interaction).

Seven chapters (see details on [wiley](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Theory+of+Ground+Vehicles%2C+4th+Edition-p-9780470170380) website)
  1. MECHANICS OF PNEUMATIC TIRES.
  2. MECHANICS OF VEHICLE-TERRAIN INTERACTION--TERRAMECHANICS.
  3. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF ROAD VEHICLES.
  4. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF OFF-ROAD VEHICLES.
  5. HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS OF ROAD VEHICLES.
  6. STEERING OF TRACKED VEHICLES.
  7. VEHICLE RIDE CHARACTERISTICS.
  8. INTRODUCTION TO AIR-CUSHION VEHICLES.
  
The original edition (350 pages) was published in 1978. The 2nd edition in 1993 and the third edition in 2001.


* John C Dixon, **Tires, Suspension and Handling**, 1996 (2nd edition, SAE International)

Quite advanced, and rather short on illustrations. 621 pages.
 
 No ebook available on [google books](https://books.google.fr/books?id=r6pTAAAAMAAJ), you can find the paper version on ([amazon](https://www.amazon.fr/Tires-Suspension-Handling-John-Dixon/dp/1560918314)).
 
The first edition (1991) was printed by Cambridge University Press.

 The author also wrote **The Shock Absorber Handbook** and **Suspension Geometry and computation**

* T. Gillespie, **Fundamentals of Vehicle Dynamics**, 1992, Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)

The only classic without any updated edition ?
