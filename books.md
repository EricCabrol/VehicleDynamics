## Some major books about Vehicle Dynamics

### The reference about tires ###

* **Hans B Pacejka, _Tyre and Vehicle Dynamics_, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2012 (3rd edition, 670 pages)**

Professor Pacejka from Delft University is the author of the well-known Magic Formula, and his book is definitely an undisputed reference on the subject.

Three editions in 2002, 2006, 2012. 

### The classic ones ###

* **J.Y. Wong. _Theory of Ground Vehicles_, 2008**

Editor : Wiley / 1st edition : 1978 / 2nd ed : 1993 / 3rd ed : 2001 / 4th ed : 2008 (560 pages)

Covers off-road vehicles, including tractors, etc. Includes a whole chapter on "terramechanics" (vehicle terrain interaction).

Seven chapters (see details on [wiley](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Theory+of+Ground+Vehicles%2C+4th+Edition-p-9780470170380) website).

<sub><sup>  1. MECHANICS OF PNEUMATIC TIRES. 
  2. MECHANICS OF VEHICLE-TERRAIN INTERACTION--TERRAMECHANICS.
  3. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF ROAD VEHICLES.
  4. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF OFF-ROAD VEHICLES.
  5. HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS OF ROAD VEHICLES.
  6. STEERING OF TRACKED VEHICLES.
  7. VEHICLE RIDE CHARACTERISTICS.
  8. INTRODUCTION TO AIR-CUSHION VEHICLES.</sub></sup>
  
The original edition (350 pages) was published in 1978. The 2nd edition in 1993 and the third edition in 2001.


* **John C Dixon, _Tires, Suspension and Handling_, 1996**

1st edition : 1991 (Cambridge Univ. Press) / 2nd edition : 1996 (SAE International)

Quite advanced, and rather short on illustrations. 621 pages.
 
 No ebook available on [google books](https://books.google.fr/books?id=r6pTAAAAMAAJ), you can find the paper version on ([amazon](https://www.amazon.fr/Tires-Suspension-Handling-John-Dixon/dp/1560918314)).
 
 The author also wrote _The Shock Absorber Handbook_ and _Suspension Geometry and computation_

* **T. Gillespie, Fundamentals of Vehicle Dynamics, 1992**

Editor : SAE / 1st edition : 1992

The only classic without any updated edition ? Looks quite old now.
