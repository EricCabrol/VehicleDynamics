## Some major books about Vehicle Dynamics


* John C Dixon, **Tires, Suspension and Handling**, 1996 (2nd edition, SAE International)

 The first edition (1991), printed in 1991 by Cambridge University Press, was one of the first reference books on the subject. Quite advanced, and rather short on illustrations,
