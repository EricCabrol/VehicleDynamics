NB : the categories below reflect my personal view only, and not a "truth" (which doesn't exist)

Champions
* [IPG CarMaker](https://ipg-automotive.com/fr/produits-et-services/simulation-software/carmaker/)
* [CarSim](https://www.carsim.com/). The company (Mechanical Simulation) was founded by Thomas Gillespie, author of a [reference book](https://github.com/EricCabrol/VehicleDynamics/blob/master/books.md) about vehicle dynamics. 
* [VI-CarRealTime](https://www.vi-grade.com/en/products/vi-carrealtime/)
* [Dyna4](https://www.vector.com/int/en/products/products-a-z/software/dyna4/), created by TESIS, acquired in 2019 by VECTOR.
* [MSC Adams/Car](https://www.mscsoftware.com/fr/product/adamscar) which unlike the others is a multibody solver, hence more "generic" but less computationally efficient.
* [MSC Adams Real-Time](https://www.mscsoftware.com/fr/product/adams-real-time) for RT applications
 

Challengers :
* [Modelon Vehicle Dynamics Library](https://www.modelon.com/library/vehicle-dynamics-library), based on Modelica
* [Simcenter Amesim](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/fr/products/simulation-test/vehicle-dynamics.html) with a dedicated Vehicle Dynamics library
* [Simulink Vehicle Dynamics Blockset](https://www.mathworks.com/products/vehicle-dynamics.html) since Mathworks could not miss the field unoccupied :)
* [AVSimulation Callas](https://www.avsimulation.com/callas-vehicle-dynamics-model-runtime/), included in the SCANeR simulation suite.
* [dSpace ASM Vehicle Dynamics](https://www.dspace.com/en/pub/home/products/sw/automotive_simulation_models/produkte_asm/vehicle_dynamics_models.cfm), probably convenient for users of dSpace hardware.

See also :
* [ChassisSim](https://www.chassissim.com/), with the excellent youtube channel animated by Danny Nowlan. Recently partnered with [Altair](https://altairengineering.fr/chassissim/)
* [SimVehicleLT](https://www.faac.com/realtime-technologies/products/simvehiclelt/) (not well known)
* [MapleCar](https://www.maplesoft.com/webinars/recorded/featured.aspx?id=1288) : looks like a student project at that time
